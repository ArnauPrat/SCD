SCD
===

High quality, scalable and parallel community detection for large real graphs.
SCD is the implementation of the algorithm described in this paper from WWW 2014.


== Compiling ==

SCD uses CMake 2.8.2 or greater to compile. In order to build SCD, move to SCD directory and type:

'''
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
''' 

This will create a build directory into the SCD folder tree, and configure and build SCD in Release mode.
In order to compile SCD in Debug mode, please replace the last two lines of the snippet above by:

'''
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
''' 

== Execution ==

To execute SCD type, move to the build folder and type:

'''
./scd -f [network file name]
'''

where the network file contains an edge at each line, an each edge is represented as a pair of numeric identifiers. 
IMPORTANT: each edge is interpreted as an undirected edge and can only appear once. For example,
if "1 2" appears in the file, then "2 1" cannot appear too. The next snipped shows a valid network file:

'''
1 2
4 5
3 4
1 3
'''

Therefore, if our network file is at ".networks/network.dat", we will type:

'''
./scd -f ./networks/network.dat
'''

This will run the program, and the will output the communities found at "./communities.dat", which
a community per line, represented as a list of identifiers.

Now, we summarize the options of the program:

  *  -f [netork file name] : Specifies the network file.
  *  -o [output file name] : Specifies the output file name.
  *  -n [number of threads]: Specifies the number of threads to run the algorithm.
